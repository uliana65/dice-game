            <p id="rules-text1">Take turns with Computer to roll 6 dice. After a roll, the 
                            <br>scoring dice are tallied and set aside. You can then either: 
                        <br><br>a) finish your turn and add your points to your game score, or
                            <br>b) roll the remaining dice to try and score more points.
                        <br><br>If all 6 dice score points, you can still try and score more
                            <br>by rolling all the six dice again. If none of your dice score
                            <br>points, you lose ALL your points from THAT turn and your
                            <br>turn is over.
                        <br><br>NOTE! The scoring combinations must be rolled in one throw,
                            <br>meaning you cannot re-use results from earlier throws. You
                            <br>win the game if you score more points than Computer.
                            <br>The game is over when a player gains 500 points.
